Military Base Decor
=================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BuiltBrokenModding/MilitaryBaseDecor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BuiltBrokenModding/MilitaryBaseDecor)

This mod is a split off from the ICBM 2 rewrite that removed concrete. The mod started as a way to keep some of the old decoration blocks alive. However, has evolved into providing any and all decoration needed for military bases. This includes decorations from several different military eras. As well provides generic era based blocks that would have exists during those time periods

NOTE: The mod is still not finished, please do not post issues on missing content, broken stuff, and similar. Chances are we are already aware of the bugs and missing content, please be patient!
